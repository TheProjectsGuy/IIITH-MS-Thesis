\section{Robotic Systems}

Write in the end. Add the following in this section

\begin{itemize}
    \item Components of an autonomous robot system: Environment + 
        Perception + Localization and map building + Cognition, path 
        planning + Motion control. Highlight Localization and map 
        building (as "contributed area").
    \item Parts of a localization (SLAM) system and where VPR plays a 
        role
    \item Image retrieval as a part of VPR systems. Elaborate the 
        space/place of VPR (very brief of \cite{Garg2021WhereIY}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Autonomous Agents}

A brief on AGI for autonomous robots. Open set works with Foundation 
Models (that work in any setting) are trending: Drive Anywhere 
\cite{Wang2023DriveAG}, MUVO \cite{Bogdoll2023MUVOAM}, GAIA
\cite{Hu2023GAIA1AG}.

\subsection{Localization and Mapping}

Info on SLAM systems

\subsection{Visual Place Recognition}

VPR and image retrieval

\section{Foundation Models}

Brief on Foundation Models. Two paragraphs maximum.
